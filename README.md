## Daily Scheduling Planner Application

This web app displays timeblocks for the current day such that someone can input and log various tasks in hour increments. 
The app uses moment.js to auto update for what day of the week it is. Also it uses moment to show what time it is and which time blocks have passed for the day.

The time block events store the input text into local storage such that it stays even when the page is refreshed until the user deletes it.
